## Getting Started

## Examples

Search Mutex name in malware:

```python
import sys
import argparse
from disass.Disass32 import Disass32

disass = Disass32(path='malware.exe', verbose=True)

if disass.go_to_next_call('CreateMutex'):
    address_mutex = disass.get_arguments(3)
    print "  Mutex\t:", disass.get_string(address_mutex)

```


It's possible to navigate easily with X references

import sys
from disass.Disass32 import Disass32

disass = Disass32(path='malware.exe', verbose=True)

for address in disass.xref['InternetOpenA']:
    disass.set_position(address)

    # Do some code
```
